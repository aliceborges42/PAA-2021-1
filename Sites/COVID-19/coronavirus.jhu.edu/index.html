caption="COVID-19 testing data are crucial for the continued pandemic response, but testing utilization and availability began to decrease following vaccine rollout. Data on testing accessibility are necessary to ensure equitable and effective distribution of testing, which will in turn improve the quality of testing data for monitoring COVID-19 transmission." isdrafted="false" id="118" content="The development of reliable tests for COVID-19 was one of the first major triumphs in the pandemic, but rollout in the United States was plagued with failed technologies,<sup>1</sup> inconsistent messaging,<sup>2</sup> limited data on who had access, and testing facilities that could not keep up with demand or provide real-time data publicly.<sup>3</sup> Over time, states were able to adapt to demand and provide testing and real-time testing data updates. Data aggregation services had access to consistent, reliable data, in the aggregate, about tests for over a year. COVID-19 testing has been one of the most important mitigation strategies for controlling Covid and some of the most essential data, but states have been neglecting it.  

After the rollout of vaccinations, testing and testing data took a back seat. Many state and federal testing sites closed<sup>4</sup> while others were converted into vaccination centers,<sup>5</sup> significantly reducing access to testing. Where once every state had clear instructions to help its residents find a local testing site along with explanations of cost and insurance, it is now incredibly difficult to find a convenient testing site or at-home tests. This lack of access to testing has been personally experienced by multiple members of the staff here at the Coronavirus Resource Center, who should be well-equipped to find available COVID-19 tests.  

Removal of testing accessibility negatively impacts the quality of testing data and diminishes the capacity of a key strategy for controlling Covid in the community. Some states have even stopped regularly publishing testing data. For these states, the CRC sources testing data from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ dataset,<sup>6</sup> which is often itself incomplete due to reporting delays. Even among states that report testing data on their dashboards, testing data has persisted as the worst performer when it comes to data available broken down by demographics. Only a handful of states provide test data disaggregated by demographics, which is a [critical tool to better understand disease transmission and stop community outbreaks](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/pandemic-data-initiative/news/filling-in-the-map-of-covid-19-demographic-data). As shown below, [40 states do not provide testing data broken down by age, 42 do not disaggregate for sex or ethnicity, and 47 do not provide racial breakdowns of testing data](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/racial-data-transparency) as of Sept. 24.  

![Testing-Demographic-Reports.jpg]()  

**Testing data remain essential**. COVID-19 is and persists to be a disease that has significant impact on local communities and interventions are best applied at the community level. Testing informs public health officials and epidemiologists on disease spread within states, municipalities, and communities. If testing data are restricted and only available from certain groups within a state, then the data become highly biased. Interpretation of this skewed, incomplete data can result in the implementation of ineffective mitigation and relief strategies. If testing data only comes from a wealthy area of a given state, then the impact of COVID-19 on poor populations is completely unreported. There is no way to detect COVID-19 spread in a community and provide assistance if there is no testing data.  

Testing is also essential to protect the unvaccinated, including children. Rapidly identifying and isolating people who are infected is essential to stopping onward transmission and for connecting people to life-saving care. Many employers are offering the option to provide daily testing in lieu of receiving an FDA-approved COVID-19 vaccine. While the CRC strongly supports vaccination, there are people who will need access to testing to continue to work, go to school, travel, or attend concerts and sporting events. There are also many who still cannot get vaccinated because they are underage. Testing helps protect teachers, staff, and families that interact frequently with young children. This is crucial since there are additional barriers to testing children themselves, such as requiring a pediatrician’s order when testing sites cannot test young children.<sup>7</sup>  

In addition to raw testing data, **we also need information on accessibility and timeliness — testing location, supply, and test type**. There is no national-level understanding of testing availability by location or demographic characteristics, creating gaps in our understanding of who is being tested. States should collect and publish testing accessibility data to help identify social barriers to testing that can be addressed through funding or policy changes. To continue testing everyone who needs a test, we must first clarify who is receiving tests and who isn’t. Additionally, testing accessibility data will allow researchers to investigate how testing inhibits SARS-CoV-2 transmission. This knowledge could significantly impact mitigation efforts and the response to future public health crises. We also need to know what kinds of tests are being used. Home tests, while essential to quickly diagnosing and limiting the spread of infection, may not be captured by public health surveillance systems.  

This data should go far and beyond the “number of tests conducted” metric, which was used early in the pandemic to promise adequate testing coverage. We need real-time monitoring of testing availability. Once those data are collected they need to be provided to the public in a manner that is useful for locating and utilizing testing services. When people do get tested, we need to make sure that health departments continue or begin to collect **detailed demographic metainformation and data on vaccination status**.  

![CDC-Vaccine-finder.jpg]()  

States used to be much better about providing testing earlier in the pandemic. Dashboard pages and telephone hotlines to lead callers to the nearest available test were kept up to date with the most accurate testing availability information. That passion and infrastructure for testing needs to return. State health department websites and COVID-19 dashboards are well suited to provide testing accessibility data, but the CDC could also take the lead. In fact, the CDC has already produced a vaccine accessibility site (shown above for Baltimore, MD) that tracks vaccine location, type, and stock.<sup>8</sup> This kind of database should be created for testing as well.  

At its heart, this issue of testing accessibility speaks to equity and health disparities that continues to hinder pandemic response in the United States. We need to ensure everyone who needs a test can get one. If we do not adequately support testing, then this pandemic is not going away any time soon.

- Pfizer-BioNTech’s mRNA COVID-19 vaccine has now received full FDA approval for those aged 16 and over; it continues to have emergency use authorization for those aged 12 to 15.
- Full FDA approval has led some entities, including the U.S. Military, to mandate COVID-19 immunization.
- While the rate of immunization has increased following full FDA approval of Pfizer’s vaccine, we still need higher numbers of Americans to be immunized at a faster pace to get ahead of Delta and other emerging variants.

For those paying close attention to the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines, August 23, 2021 was a landmark day. The U.S. FDA granted what’s called a BLA (Biologics License Application) for the Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, making this the first fully approved COVID-19 vaccine in the country. The vaccine was also given a brand name, Comirnaty, and was approved for those aged 16 and over. For those aged 12 to 15, the vaccine will still be available under the earlier emergency use authorization (EUA) though full approval for that age group is also being sought. For many physicians and other scientists, the full approval is useful, but not essential to their decision-making, since the vaccine has been shown in “real world” use to be highly effective, very safe, and continues to show robust protection against serious COVID-19 disease, hospitalization, and death, including protection against these severe outcomes with the Delta variant. But for many others – from the U.S. Military leadership to corporate boardrooms to school boards and event organizers – full authorization is a sea change. The U.S. Military, to use one example, was previously reluctant to mandate immunization with vaccines with EUA status, but the U.S. Department of Defense quickly moved after the full FDA approval to mandating vaccines for all armed services personnel. Many companies have made the same decision, including some of the largest health care employers in the nation. Johns Hopkins, where I teach, has mandated Covid-19 vaccines for all faculty, students, and staff who want to be on our campuses, with exemptions for medical conditions and religious objection, granted only on a case-by-case basis and with a formal process for review.

How important are these changes? Very. The U.S. immunization campaign by any measure has been a success. But coverage remains too low, still below 65% of eligible Americans, and too spotty, with significant parts of the country falling well below that national average. Predictably, but tragically, unvaccinated people – and the low coverage communities many reside in – are being ravaged by the Delta variant, and we are again seeing unacceptably high hospitalization and death rates among the unvaccinated. This current wave is all the more troubling and emotionally challenging for health care providers, since these are overwhelmingly preventable hospitalizations and needless losses of life.  

Since the full approval of the vaccine, and the start of vaccine mandates across multiple sectors, immunization rates are increasing again, but the science shows clearly that we need higher numbers of Americans to be immunized. And, we need a faster rate of immunization to get ahead of Delta and other emerging variants. Both pace and coverage matter.

So, will full approval impact vaccine hesitancy? Surprisingly, only a small proportion of Americans are opposed to all vaccines and immunization. The American Academy of Pediatrics estimates that only about 1% of U.S. parents refuse all vaccines for their children and families. That small group is unlikely to be moved by full approval. But there are many millions more Americans who have waited, with vary degrees of uncertainty, to see if the vaccines are truly safe and worth the risk. At least some of these people may be more willing to be immunized with a fully approved vaccine.

But for many, the choice to remain unvaccinated against COVID-19 is going to be increasingly difficult now that one vaccine is fully approved – and likely in the coming few months, 2 more vaccines, as Moderna and Johnson and Johnson seek and attain full approval. And the change here is going to be mandates for many tied to employment, education, and access to venues and services. In addition to vaccine requirements, many entities, from corporations to public schools to college campuses, may allow some people to remain unvaccinated but will have such rigorous testing and reporting requirements for these people that many will find immunization preferable to such onerous requirements. Other employers have taken another step which may add pressure: refusal to cover COVID-19-related health costs, including hospitalization, for those who choose to remain unvaccinated. Since COVID-19 hospitalizations when one is not vaccinated can lead to catastrophic outcomes and long intensive care stays, these costs could be enormous.


Where does that leave us? The best protection against COVID-19 remains immunization, and full approval for Pfizer’s Comirnaty vaccine will almost certainly significantly increase our coverage, and hopefully our pace of immunization. We’ll have to continue with non-vaccine prevention, including mask-wearing indoors, for some time, since children under 12 remain ineligible for vaccines, and at risk. We can only hope – and work with – the remaining millions of Americans who have not been immunized to get their doses. This will protect them against disease and death, protect others around them, lessen the burden on our health systems, and help us get out of the epidemic.

- Among hospitalized adults, nearly all are unvaccinated, which speaks to the power of the Covid-19 vaccines.  
- Delta has underscored the importance of vaccinating as much of the population as possible.  

The recent media headlines are all Delta, Delta, Delta, and it’s not the airline. The last several weeks have brought sobering findings that have produced a large alteration in both the American and scientific psyche about COVID-19 vaccines, the trajectory of the epidemic, and the understanding that life can sometimes just be complicated. We first saw the Alpha variant, which was two times more infectious than the ancestral strain, followed by Beta, which was eight times more resistant in laboratory assays to neutralization, and which also reduced vaccine efficacy. And now Delta is here and just ripping through both of them, like a hot knife through butter, replacing Beta with the same rapidity that it replaced Alpha and all the in-between variants.  

So, what is it about this Delta, or what I should say, many Deltas? Because what we’re seeing is this fascinating, scientific change in the virus that’s happened at incredible rapidity. Delta has some new characteristics that make it a formidable foe. It’s much more infectious to others; initial titers of the virus in the nose seem to be higher than previous strains with more rapid spread into the lungs and other organs within the body. It is clear that the amount of virus required to infect others is lower, making transmissibility to household and casual contacts more efficient than the other variants. Case numbers are quickly increasing, ICUs are filling up, and most disconcertingly, we are seeing more children being admitted in our pediatric hospitals. When we look at who’s in the hospital among adults, we see an unprecedented number of people who have not been vaccinated – 95 to 98 percent. The same pattern is seen with children. COVID-19 Delta strain is a hospital epidemic of the unvaccinated.  

Yes, we are now seeing outbreaks of Delta in which vaccinated people are infected. These outbreaks involve two behaviors that result in super-spreader events – crowding and indoor revelry with drinking and eating and no masks. Eating, drinking, shouting, singing – spraying forth, shall we say, produces a density of unseen viral particles in the air. These behaviors are the food of the virus – a heavy smorgasbord of food: all advantageous to the virus. The result is that we are seeing humans get infected. For the vaccinated, this means just mild infection. But for the unvaccinated, we are seeing rapid spread of the virus to the lungs and other parts of the body.  

We’ve seen a necessary reintroduction of masking in our country and a return of anxiety to much of the populace. Will our children be able to safely go back to school? Can we safely go back to work? Will we ever be able to relax and enjoy dinner indoors again with friends, extended family, or in professional settings? Delta is disconcerting to all of us. Today, I cancelled a COVID-19 Prevention Network (CoVPN) scientific meeting scheduled for October – one that I’d been eagerly planning and anticipating for months. We wanted to meet and celebrate/review the work the network has done. The success of the program and the hard work and toil have shaped professional careers dramatically, if not entire worldviews. We wanted to revel in the camaraderie of the team’s success and do so in person. But it was clear – even though the event required vaccination to attend – no one wanted to come to Seattle to celebrate with the possible risk it would carry if anyone contracted Delta and had to be quarantined away from home.  

Let’s look at vaccination and Delta as it relates to the U.S.:  

1. The mRNA and Janssen vaccines are highly effective against death and hospitalization (greater than 90 to 98%).  
2. The protection from getting symptomatic COVID-19 appears to be a bit less with the Delta variant – studies show a range from 85% to 40% – and this may differ by time post-vaccination. But in all studies the severity of illness is markedly less – the immune system of vaccinated persons can rapidly clear Delta. As noted above, severe disease among the vaccinated in the U.S. with the mRNA or Janssen vaccines is rare.  
3. Transmission to others from vaccinated persons can occur but it is less than from the unvaccinated population, although we have not yet demonstrated how much less.
So, yes, one can still get infected with Delta despite being vaccinated if one doesn’t use precautions. That’s a fact. But a bigger fact is that you won’t get very sick, and you can reduce the risk of acquiring COVID-19 and spreading it if you wear a mask.  

Perhaps we shouldn’t have been surprised. We understood that reducing acquisition of COVID-19 was a harder goal than ameliorating disease. But we do know the vaccines work and countless lives have been saved by them. So, the vaccines have markedly changed the dynamic of our thought process, but maybe what we need is to change our expectations.  

What do I mean by that?  

Well, the virus is teaching us another important lesson: it can adapt with amazing speed. It’s hard to understand how a virus like this is rolling through the world. But rolling through it is. Recent data out of Israel estimates that every six to nine days the Delta infection among its population doubles. As Israel has the highest percent vaccination rate (with the Pfizer/BioNTech mRNA vaccine) of any adult population in the world, this is at first glance surprising. However, it’s less surprising when one recognizes that younger people are not yet vaccinated, and it’s the unvaccinated that are the main fuel for that kind of speed.  

Why is it so transmissible? What selective pressure is it under? It doesn’t have the obvious neutralization-resistant mutations. What part of the human immune response that you get from vaccination is being delayed by the Delta variant? Will boosters actually slow it down or is it really more important to focus our efforts on reaching the unvaccinated? These are all scientific questions needing answers. As Israel has made the decision to boost its elderly population, some data about the role that boosting can play in reducing disease spread will be obtained.  

But the boosting issue is a bit of a diversion from the main issue in our country, which is: how do we reduce the spread of this highly infectious variant?  

Do we need a national mandate for vaccination? Is personal choice to vaccinate or not the defining moment here? Or is the defining moment that we all have a societal obligation to not be the fuel for the forest fire? The unvaccinated in some respects are an unsuspecting accomplice to the arsonist at large – they serve as bone-dry tinder for the lighted match. 
Should we rethink this?  

Our body politics are not allowing a universal approach to public health. Do our corporate leaders who can mandate vaccination step up to the plate? Does anyone really believe that the Emergency Use Authorization is that much different than the FDA licensing it under a full Biologics License Application? Does any argument saying that the FDA hasn’t certified it bring out any sense of credulity? Yes, there are important steps to licensing the medication so that there is consistency from lot to lot in manufacturing. But at 400 million vaccinated and growing daily, we have ample safety and efficacy data.  

So, yes, official product licensure is, to this author, not an appropriate reason to hold back mandated vaccination. Each day the documentation of the positive effect of the vaccines grows, and we understand that the virus is continuing to mutate. So, decreasing the fuel options is really the only way to slow down the rate of mutational alterations.  

It is true that the Delta variant has swept in like a cold, damp morning shrouded by fog. And it’s left us with a bit of a shiver. But like all days, morning turns to afternoon and the sun gets higher in the horizon and some of the fog lifts. Although Delta has taken us two steps back, a much more important step forward is to continue to vaccinate as many of our citizens as we can. Once we do, Delta may move itself two steps back, putting us once again two steps forward toward pre-COVID-19 normalcy." order="0" attachments="" verticals="" data-tracking-id="article-card" href="/vaccines/blog/vaccination-and-the-delta-variant-four-steps-forward-two-steps-back"><div class="ArticleCard_text__2_Rz4"><div class="ArticleCard_text-content-wrapper__1ble9"><header><p class="category">August 16, 2021</p><h3>Vaccination and the Delta Variant: Four Steps Forward, Two Steps Back</h3></header><p>By <!-- -->Larry Corey</p></div></div></a></div><div class="ArticleGrid_group__333Ow SingleCard" data-group-type="SingleCard" style="-ms-grid-row:1;grid-row:1;-ms-grid-column:5;grid-column:5"><a aria-label="July 23, 2021, Tale of Two Intersecting Epidemics: Why We Need mRNA Vaccines in Africa, and For All Who Are Immunocompromised" role="link" class="ArticleCard_base__ymO6l ArticleCard_layout-vertical__zOrRw ArticleCard_minor__2rIWK" meta="[object Object]" caption="*The views and opinions expressed here are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the position of either Johns Hopkins University and Medicine or the University of Washington.*" isdrafted="false" id="88" content="- Individuals living with HIV and compromised immune systems may have prolonged shedding of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.

This title is one Larry used twenty years ago when talking about the intersection between the sexually transmitted infection genital herpes (HSV-2) and HIV. At the time, he was describing how HSV-2 increased the risk of HIV acquisition and HIV made the severity of HSV-2 worse, and how this relationship between the two conditions created an epidemiological synergy with concomitant additional misery for humankind. This title is applicable today about the intersecting pandemics of HIV and COVID-19.  

Individuals living with HIV have a degree of immunosuppression that varies based on their therapy and disease course. If the disease course is well controlled and fully virologically suppressed on antiretroviral therapy, there is evidence to believe that these patients are at a normal risk of acquiring and controlling COVID-19, much like others in their families and communities. This analogy is partially accurate in that those living with HIV can, because of their medicines, have obesity, diabetes, and increased lung disease, which are all predispositions or comorbidities associated with severe COVID-19.  

Importantly, there are subsets of persons living with HIV – including those who are immune deficient with low T cell counts, those with viremia due to drug resistant HIV viral strains, those not receiving or not taking antiretroviral therapy, and the many millions we know are living with undiagnosed HIV infection, including those recently infected. These persons are subject to acquire persistent, prolonged SARS-CoV-2 infection, akin to organ transplant recipients and severely immunosuppressed cancer patients. There are many causes of immunocompromise but in many countries HIV infection is among the most common. A recent [case report](https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.03.21258228) by Karim et al. from South Africa, the country with the largest percent of the population living with HIV, described a case of HIV infection in a person who had very low CD4 counts due to resistant virus and a lack of compliance who developed COVID-19. Over a period of 200 days, this patient – who was ambulatory, living in the community, and without serious symptoms – shed SARS-CoV-2. They had mild illness early on, which is why they were observed, and because of HIV, follow-up care ensued. The investigators had samples from the patient, and they shed SARS-CoV-2 at high titers, showing the development of multi-mutational changes in the virus over time. These mutational changes essentially recapitulated the Beta variant, which has 9 to 11 different mutational changes than the original ancestral strain. This case illustrates why we are writing this blog to talk about how individual patients living with HIV and compromised immune systems who have this prolonged shedding pattern can result in the kind of mutational changes that lead to germination and spread of variants of concern in our communities.  

This case is illustrative because it’s not rare. It’s illustrative because out of the estimated 38 million people living with HIV worldwide, South Africa alone has more than 16 million citizens, or 25%, of its 65 million people living with HIV. So okay, the two epidemics are intertwined, what’s the concern? Well, the concern is that these people will suffer more serious COVID-19 cases and that they may serve as the potential unwitting source of new variants through household and community contacts.  

As the greatest population of persons living with HIV is in sub-Saharan Africa, where vaccination rates are currently less than 2% of the populace, this continual reservoir of variant generation is and should be of concern to all of us. We need to recognize that we do not have a demonstrably effective vaccine against COVID-19 among persons living with HIV. The data that we have from the Novavax study in South Africa showed absolutely no efficacy against COVID-19. In the Ensemble Johnson &amp; Johnson (J&amp;J) study, too few cases were acquired to adequately evaluate the effectiveness of the one-dose J&amp;J vaccine. And in the Moderna trial, no cases of COVID-19 were reported in the 150 HIV+ recipients who received vaccination. The reason for the lack of efficacy of the Novavax vaccine is bothersome as the post-vaccination binding antibody titers were well above natural infection and in the range associated with reasonable efficacy (median 33,000).  

So, what’s going on here? The answer is, we don’t know the reason for lack of effectiveness, but we do know that the mRNA vaccines offer the most immediate solution to this major hole in the public health control of SARS-CoV-2 variants. The data suggest that we need to take our most potent vaccines – mRNA or perhaps two doses of the J&amp;J vaccine or a heterologous prime boost with one of the vaccines being an mRNA vaccine – into areas of the world where there are high burdens of HIV and COVID-19 co-circulating. We need to urgently take steps to evaluate if our best vaccine regimens are able to effectively prevent acquisition of COVID-19 in all persons living with HIV but especially among those with uncontrolled HIV.  

The tale of these two intersecting epidemics needs a better ending than what we – as a global community – are currently creating. The Delta variant epidemic is rapidly illustrating that chasing variants is not a successful strategy. The Delta variant has swept through countries like the UK, Israel, and South Africa in four to eight weeks and is the dominant variant in the United States at a speed that, even with RNA technologies, we cannot match. Our approach must be to slow down the generation of these rapidly doubling super-spreading micro-epidemics of infection among unvaccinated persons.  

The equation today among those unvaccinated individuals is not whether you will get COVID-19 infection but when you will get it. Slowing it down requires our best vaccine products and strategies. It’s certainly not too late. But we need both studies and implementation of our most potent vaccines and vaccine regimens to be applied to all of our immunosuppressed populations, the largest of which is HIV, for us to have a globally effective strategy.

The United States has now authorized children as young as 12 years old to be vaccinated while the most vulnerable adults in many other nations still lack vaccine access. It’s a complicated question. William Moss, vaccinology lead for the CRC and executive director of the International Vaccine Access Center, discusses the need for the United States to exert worldwide leadership in fighting the global pandemic.  " isdrafted="false" id="65" content="### Is the U.S. donation of 80 million doses enough to make a global difference?  

No, it’s far from adequate. It’s a small step in the right direction. It’s a good gesture. But the United States needs to play a much bigger role if we’re going to address the global vaccine inequities between high and middle- and low-income countries. The [world vaccination map](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/vaccines/international) on the Coronavirus Resource Center website provides a stark illustration of how vaccines are being administered in richer nations far faster than anywhere else.  

### Is there a number that would provide the world with a serious infusion of vaccines?  

There isn’t a specific number, but for context here is one way to think about it. There are 8 billion people in the world. Each one would need two shots. That’s 16 billion doses. Say we want to vaccinate 70% of the world population to really try to stop this pandemic – that's more than 11 billion doses. Now you can see how 20 million or 60 million or 80 million doses is really a trivial amount considering the challenge ahead for the world.  

My understanding is that there are several hundred million doses available each month in the United States. An 80 million donation is a drop in the bucket.  

### How can the United States get those doses into the arms of citizens of other nations?  

There are three strategies that countries can follow for vaccine donations overseas.  

The first is to deliver them through the COVAX Facility, which I think is the best. That’s the primary global mechanism for getting vaccines to low- and middle-income nations. They use equity to determine where to deliver the vaccines, with the number of doses proportional to the population size. COVAX is thus the most equitable. The Biden Administration said it would be supporting the COVAX Facility, so that’s a good thing.  

> ‘A donation of 80 million vaccine doses is a trivial amount considering the challenge ahead for the world.’  

A second strategy is to target hotspots and emerging hotspots. For example, some of those doses are going to be targeted to India, which is facing a tragic surge in cases. The idea is to get vaccines to where they are needed most. But it has to be done early. That’s the trick and the challenge with that approach.  

And then the third strategy is based on foreign policy decisions. This is my least favorite. For example, the Biden Administration has donated doses to Canada and Mexico, obviously because they are countries on our borders where we have a self-interest in preventing virus importations.  

### Is there enough time to deliver the vaccines to make a difference?  

Well, with India, I must say, it's late. Technically, it’s never really too late but vaccines take time to be administered and to work so they’re not a short-term solution. But right now it’s so far behind the curve. Let’s say all 60 million of the AstraZeneca doses go to India. It’s going to take some time to even get those doses into people. Then you need to give them two doses. And then you’re not fully immunized until two weeks later. That’s really a strategy to help two months down the line not during a terrible surge in cases. Not that it’s wrong to do this, but you have to temper your expectations as to what it is going to do.  

You can look at where outbreaks are really emerging like in Nepal or Thailand to target vaccine doses.  

### What more can the United States do to address the global situation?  

The United States needs to do a lot more than donating vaccines. That’s just one part of a portfolio in addressing global vaccine inequities. The United States needs to support the expansion of vaccine manufacturing both domestically and abroad. It needs to help build that capacity, provide training for personnel, and relax export restrictions on supplies, reagents, and chemicals that go into manufacturing vaccines.  

This needs to be a global partnership among the wealthy nations to coordinate all of the responses needed.  

> ‘The U.S. needs to do a lot more than donating vaccines to address global vaccine inequities.’

It is in the self-interest of the United States to do this because we are always going to be at risk of importing SARS-CoV-2, and the risk of importing variants for which our current vaccines may be less effective. It’s really enlightened self-interest to try to reduce transmission and to get this pandemic under control everywhere. We need to substantially reduce the burden of disease for humanitarian purposes and reduce transmission of the virus for self-interest to prevent the emergence of variants that could cause outbreaks in the United States.  

We are already at a point in the United States where we have a surplus of vaccines. Obviously we expanded eligibility for children 12 to 15 years old, and this will increase our need. But the demand is decreasing among  adults in the United States and we’re going to have excess doses.  

To date 1.7 billion COVID-19 vaccine doses have been produced. We’re still at a small fraction of what is needed to vaccinate the world and we’re not going to get much of the world vaccinated until 2023. This needs to be an urgent and collaborative global effort.  
 
### Can surplus vaccines be used as booster shots later?  

I believe that is one of the reasons why there has been some reluctance to donate a large number of doses. It’s still a bit uncertain about the timing and need for booster doses. Many experts believe we will need them. The question is when. The Biden Administration justifiably has been focused on bringing the pandemic under control in the United States. It does not want to put the United States into a shortage, which I think is reasonable. But the United States still need to be a global leader in addressing global vaccine inequities.  

The United States will need to maintain a supply of vaccine for potential booster doses. Now if there is a new variant that is driving the need for additional vaccine doses, we could use the current vaccine as a booster, but we may also need a new vaccine created specifically to target a variant.

Data on testing accessibility are necessary to ensure equitable and effective distribution of testing, which will in turn improve the quality of testing data for monitoring COVID-19 transmission." isdrafted="false" id="118" content="The development of reliable tests for COVID-19 was one of the first major triumphs in the pandemic, but rollout in the United States was plagued with failed technologies,<sup>1</sup> inconsistent messaging,<sup>2</sup> limited data on who had access, and testing facilities that could not keep up with demand or provide real-time data publicly.<sup>3</sup> Over time, states were able to adapt to demand and provide testing and real-time testing data updates. Data aggregation services had access to consistent, reliable data, in the aggregate, about tests for over a year. COVID-19 testing has been one of the most important mitigation strategies for controlling Covid and some of the most essential data, but states have been neglecting it.  

After the rollout of vaccinations, testing and testing data took a back seat. Many state and federal testing sites closed<sup>4</sup> while others were converted into vaccination centers,<sup>5</sup> significantly reducing access to testing. Where once every state had clear instructions to help its residents find a local testing site along with explanations of cost and insurance, it is now incredibly difficult to find a convenient testing site or at-home tests. This lack of access to testing has been personally experienced by multiple members of the staff here at the Coronavirus Resource Center, who should be well-equipped to find available COVID-19 tests.  

Removal of testing accessibility negatively impacts the quality of testing data and diminishes the capacity of a key strategy for controlling Covid in the community. Some states have even stopped regularly publishing testing data. For these states, the CRC sources testing data from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ dataset,<sup>6</sup> which is often itself incomplete due to reporting delays. Even among states that report testing data on their dashboards, testing data has persisted as the worst performer when it comes to data available broken down by demographics. Only a handful of states provide test data disaggregated by demographics, which is a [critical tool to better understand disease transmission and stop community outbreaks](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/pandemic-data-initiative/news/filling-in-the-map-of-covid-19-demographic-data). As shown below, [40 states do not provide testing data broken down by age, 42 do not disaggregate for sex or ethnicity, and 47 do not provide racial breakdowns of testing data](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/racial-data-transparency) as of Sept. 24.  

![Testing-Demographic-Reports.jpg]()  

**Testing data remain essential**. COVID-19 is and persists to be a disease that has significant impact on local communities and interventions are best applied at the community level. Testing informs public health officials and epidemiologists on disease spread within states, municipalities, and communities. If testing data are restricted and only available from certain groups within a state, then the data become highly biased. Interpretation of this skewed, incomplete data can result in the implementation of ineffective mitigation and relief strategies. If testing data only comes from a wealthy area of a given state, then the impact of COVID-19 on poor populations is completely unreported. There is no way to detect COVID-19 spread in a community and provide assistance if there is no testing data.  

Testing is also essential to protect the unvaccinated, including children. Rapidly identifying and isolating people who are infected is essential to stopping onward transmission and for connecting people to life-saving care. Many employers are offering the option to provide daily testing in lieu of receiving an FDA-approved COVID-19 vaccine. While the CRC strongly supports vaccination, there are people who will need access to testing to continue to work, go to school, travel, or attend concerts and sporting events. There are also many who still cannot get vaccinated because they are underage. Testing helps protect teachers, staff, and families that interact frequently with young children. This is crucial since there are additional barriers to testing children themselves, such as requiring a pediatrician’s order when testing sites cannot test young children.<sup>7</sup>  

In addition to raw testing data, **we also need information on accessibility and timeliness — testing location, supply, and test type**. There is no national-level understanding of testing availability by location or demographic characteristics, creating gaps in our understanding of who is being tested. States should collect and publish testing accessibility data to help identify social barriers to testing that can be addressed through funding or policy changes. To continue testing everyone who needs a test, we must first clarify who is receiving tests and who isn’t. Additionally, testing accessibility data will allow researchers to investigate how testing inhibits SARS-CoV-2 transmission. This knowledge could significantly impact mitigation efforts and the response to future public health crises. We also need to know what kinds of tests are being used. Home tests, while essential to quickly diagnosing and limiting the spread of infection, may not be captured by public health surveillance systems.  

This data should go far and beyond the “number of tests conducted” metric, which was used early in the pandemic to promise adequate testing coverage. We need real-time monitoring of testing availability. Once those data are collected they need to be provided to the public in a manner that is useful for locating and utilizing testing services. When people do get tested, we need to make sure that health departments continue or begin to collect **detailed demographic metainformation and data on vaccination status**.  

![CDC-Vaccine-finder.jpg]()  

States used to be much better about providing testing earlier in the pandemic. Dashboard pages and telephone hotlines to lead callers to the nearest available test were kept up to date with the most accurate testing availability information. That passion and infrastructure for testing needs to return. State health department websites and COVID-19 dashboards are well suited to provide testing accessibility data, but the CDC could also take the lead. In fact, the CDC has already produced a vaccine accessibility site (shown above for Baltimore, MD) that tracks vaccine location, type, and stock.<sup>8</sup> This kind of database should be created for testing as well.  

At its heart, this issue of testing accessibility speaks to equity and health disparities that continues to hinder pandemic response in the United States. We need to ensure everyone who needs a test can get one. If we do not adequately support testing, then this pandemic is not going away any time soon.

Dr. Filipe Campante, Bloomberg Distinguished Associate Professor of Political Economy and Governance, explains that the bad equilibrium we are currently experiencing is due to a crowded and noisy information environment brought on by fragmented, easily accessible media streams, a period of depreciating trust in U.S. institutions, and a reduction in social capital.  

### Why do elected officials not always lead from a purely data-driven stance?  

There's a lot of information available. We're flooded with information to an unprecedented level, making it complicated to judge the quality of information. That's where political incentives emerge. Muddying that picture can play to your advantage. For example, Russia’s President Vladimir Putin realized that the state no longer needed to control information the way China does if it could flood the environment with noise. There was no need to convince people that the state was right, as long as there was no way to know what is right. Something similar has been playing out here.  

> “In a situation where there's a lot of noise in the information environment, data-driven policy will not necessarily be rewarded in the political market.”  

The public has a hard time determining whether information is right, so they will not pay a premium for high-quality information. Also, high-quality data is harder to produce, making it costlier for the producers of information — high-quality data is hard to identify, costly, and difficult to produce. That is in the media, but it extends to governance. Even in a world where voters would like to have good, data-driven policy that leads to better outcomes, you may not get that because in a noisy information environment it's hard to identify the connections between policy and outcomes, and data-driven governance may not be rewarded.  

### Can you compare the role of data in governance during Ebola versus COVID-19?  

The government handled it well back then. Ebola is the epidemic that didn't happen, as far as the United States is concerned. Research shows the Democrats were still punished for it, however, even though it was arguably staved off by good, data-driven policy. They lost votes in those midterms as a result of their reaction to the Ebola epidemic, because other politicians had an incentive to strategically exploit the situation. Many politicians tried to connect Ebola to President Obama and immigration, with some success with the immigration argument. The bottom line is that politicians are providing information in this environment, they have incentives to create noise, and in this case they were rewarded for it. Data-driven governance wasn't rewarded. That is still the case with COVID-19, where politicians are not necessarily being rewarded for data-driven decisions like encouraging vaccinations or mask mandates.  

### What changes to the information environment have enabled low-quality data to reign?  

Social media plays a big role here, but it's not only that. The generally fragmented media environment allows cheaper access by politicians to media channels. Back when there were only three major TV networks, politicians were not content creators, but now they are. That is a big change that makes the information environment less conducive to a data-driven approach. It's not just the public accessing information; the politicians are players in the information environment. Politicians used to have to own a TV channel or control the state TV to flood the information environment with noise. It's easier now because access is easier.  

### What has been the impact of increased access to data and information on social capital?  

It’s not so much the impact of data on social capital, but the other way around. Social capital boils down to the ability and the things that build the ability to engage in collective action. Trust is central to social capital because trust is what enables that collective action. In a low trust environment, the problem of the noisy information environment is magnified. You can't trust news sources if you can't trust people in general. Many people will tend to react even to high-quality information as if it’s a lie.  

> “This idea of social capital really gets at the heart of how you might end up in this low-quality policy-making trap because of the noisy information environment.”  

The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted a lot of these dynamics. It was a new disease that we knew nothing about, so people had to rely on external information. It is hard to figure out who actually knows what they're talking about because we are in a low-trust environment. The notion of social capital is critical here because it helps determine whether we're going to be in that bad equilibrium where nobody knows what's going on because you can’t trust anything. You can contrast the response that happened here, where we're living through a period of depreciating social capital, versus a place like Germany. There the majority sentiment is that the government generally knows what it’s doing and the public can follow its lead.  

### How do we cut through the noise to support high-quality data and governance?  

It’s hard. One approach from early in the pandemic was fact-checking. If we can’t prevent low-quality information from getting out, we can add another piece of high-quality information to refute it. But it's not always the case that good information will drive out bad information, it can also be the reverse. Fact-checking has often been ineffective because it just adds more information to this already overcrowded information environment. Oftentimes the way people process high-quality fact-checking information will be through that noisy lens, and they’ll say if the fact-checking goes against their views, it’s just &quot;fake news.&quot;  

Quality is hard to observe. People are going to choose their data sources through trust. Therefore, we need to look for trust relationships to share high-quality information. For instance, if we have a community that is reluctant to get vaccinated, we need to find a messenger that the community trusts. Trust is of the essence here because we're in a situation where it's hard to assess the quality of information. We need to find trustworthy messengers, knowing that there are incentives on the other side to fight back with noise.

APL was responsible for teaching local, state, and federal health agencies how to collect and use data for future planning, and is now a key contributor to delivering real-time COVID-19 data to the world." isdrafted="false" id="114" content="The first 15 years of Sheri Lewis’s career at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) focused, in part, on public health surveillance. That has included working closely with U.S. and international public health communities on the development and implementation of electronic disease surveillance systems, mobile health applications for data collection and analysis, and advanced analytics for the prediction and modeling of emerging infectious diseases.  

Now, Lewis serves on the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center’s executive team as the point person overseeing APL’s critical role in data procurement and analysis. Her perspective on the evolution of public health data infrastructure shows that local, state, and federal government agencies still have far to go to ensure better data practices to prevent and address future public health crises.  

### What has been APL’s role in the public health data space?  

In the last 20 years, APL has revolutionized electronic surveillance of diseases. Back when there was little utilization of information technology in public health, we worked with health departments, starting in the National Capital Region, to help them understand the value of utilizing data and how it would enhance their situational awareness in near real-time. Looking back from where we are now in 2021 that seems like a simple thing, but at the time it was a complete shift. Public health practitioners were really using data in a retrospective manner – when there was an outbreak, they’d dive into the data. We suggested a culture shift: looking at data prospectively and using it to make public health decisions on the front end. We helped with system development and, in parallel, we did a lot of community engagement across the U.S., trying to get public health officials to understand the value of this approach.  

ESSENCE, for example, which is the Electronic Surveillance System for the Early Notification of Community-based Epidemics, fundamentally changed the way public health professionals access and utilize data in monitoring established patterns of disease progression in their community. APL began developing that in 1997 and we’ve seen the profound impact of that tool over and over again – of course most recently in the COVID-19 pandemic – and we are continuously improving it to best serve public health.  

> “While much of APL’s early work was tech-heavy, our main challenge was simply getting people to understand the value of collecting and utilizing data closer to real-time.”  

After we started to affect change in the U.S., we began working in the global space with partner nations through the U.S. Department of Defense. We had to get them thinking about how they collected data to enable effective investigations during disease outbreaks. At times, that meant shifting not just from using data retrospectively, but from not collecting or using data at all. Globally, people were moving data around monthly at best. Speeding up the way data were collected and utilized was a huge change on the global level.  

### How has APL’s role evolved during the COVID-19 pandemic?  

One thing the COVID-19 pandemic put center stage was public health experts and public health decisions. The U.S. public also now understands a bit more about what public health does and, unique to this pandemic, has an expectation of being able to utilize data to make decisions for themselves on an individual level. The Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center is a great example of that.  

For many years the general public had very little appreciation for what public health does on a daily basis. With the CRC, we’ve brought data into everyone's living room and they are able to see the data and start to make decisions for themselves, which is really cool. I think the public has a renewed comfort level in how to view, manipulate, and use data.  

For APL, that fits us. At its fundamental core, the CRC is a health surveillance initiative. APL is an expert in understanding and using all kinds of data sources. When we stood up ESSENCE, we were using anything we could get our hands on, any type of data. The COVID-19 dashboard, especially in its early days, was somewhat similar — while we were literally only looking at case-based data, it was still an issue of being able to take the data in whatever form it’s provided. That is a uniquely APL capability, and one we were honored to assist with in the dashboard effort.  

Unfortunately, one thing the pandemic has also borne out is manipulation of that data and it has underscored the importance of trust in data sourcing and analysis. Just as people can access data and use it to make decisions for themselves, many are also choosing to take it and skew it to tell the story they want to tell. I try to put myself in someone else’s shoes, and if I were not in the field, I would look at all of the different pieces of information available now and wonder what to believe and what not to believe. I do think that we need to be mindful of that problem and figure out a way to counter it moving forward.  

### What data are available to local and state health departments?  

That really depends on what data would be most helpful to them. At this point, there is the potential to have an exponential amount of data at public health agencies’ fingertips, so the question is not, “What is available to them?” It’s really: “What is the fundamental question we’re trying to answer?” If we define that and only collect and look at data that we think will help answer that question, it will be much more useful. That’s a double-edged sword and it gives a lot of us in public health pause because nobody likes to throw away data, but unless there’s an unlimited bandwidth and storage capacity for data, you have to make tradeoffs. Additionally, if you have so much data you’re not able to properly analyze it, there’s also the question of how helpful can the data alone be?  

In the early days of building health surveillance tools like ESSENCE, our fundamental question was, “What do people do when they get sick?” Do they go to the pharmacy? Do they miss school? Do they see their doctor or go to urgent care? Are they appearing at emergency rooms – and with what symptoms?  

We started exploring all of the different data streams that would represent what people do when they get sick. If state and local public health had a good relationship with their school system, they could potentially get anonymized school absentee and nurse’s office data. We got data from poison control. We looked at point-of-sale transactions for over-the-counter pharmaceuticals. Then there were data sources that health departments had in-house such as mortality data that we were able to incorporate. From there, we got to thinking about what other sources could complement this effort that were freely available, such as weather, air quality, allergens and pollen count. When we strategically added to the data set, we were able to enhance public health practitioners’ ability to have a more complete picture of the health of their community.  

> “There's an amazing amount of data that people don't even realize exists.”  

### How would you like to see public health data change moving forward?  

Twenty years ago, after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, there was an appetite for investment in data systems. That pushed the field of public health into new areas, but it didn’t have quite the staying power to sustain what was needed to keep up with rapidly-evolving technology and data availability.  

Given the immense role public health data collection and analysis has played in the nation and the world’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic, I hope this time that enthusiasm has more staying power and the need for continuous investment into this field is clear.  

There are more states that are now collecting and utilizing data than there were previously. That's good, and we want that to continue. We want to see more consistency across the country (and globally) in terms of valuing the continuous collection and utilization of data, and we would like there to be some greater consistency across states and between the states and the federal government. The idea of a global digital health ecosystem is one we need to be thinking about and putting the pieces together to operationalize in the very near future.  

One thing I think is vitally important to state is that we don’t just need these data pipelines in a crisis – they need to be a constant tool to understand a community’s health during all times, and the ability and desire to share information must endure. We could augment data and data information sharing during surge situations to the levels we’ve seen during the pandemic, but it would be nice if we kept all the plumbing intact and did some standardization to ensure every house had the same type of pipes. Then we could increase the flow of information on an as-needed basis." order="0" attachments="/images/assets/PDI_Lewis_9babeca06e.jpg" verticals="pandemic-data-initiative" data-tracking-id="article-card" href="/pandemic-data-initiative/news/q-and-a-building-and-maintaining-public-health-data-pipelines"><div class="ArticleCard_text__2_Rz4"><div class="ArticleCard_text-content-wrapper__1ble9"><span class="ArticleCard_new-badge-inline__3Y5RQ">New</span><header><p class="category">Expert Insight</p><h3>Q&amp;A: Building and Maintaining Public Health Data Pipelines</h3></header><p>The Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory has been a key player in the international public health data field for over 20 years.

Comorbidity data is critical to better design treatments, craft health policy and response strategies, and aid in patient care for those infected by SARS-CoV-2. If they aren’t already, States should begin producing, using and sharing this data." isdrafted="false" id="115" content="Understanding a covid patient’s pre-existing health conditions has been an essential component to navigating the pandemic response. Whether it was understanding who was most at risk for hospitalization for death, how to prioritize vaccination dissemination, or how to communicate with the public, comorbidity data is critical. 
A comorbidity is simply the simultaneous presence of more than one disease or condition in a patient. Physicians and patients are most interested in comorbidities that increase one’s risk of contracting COVID-19, as shown below with diabetes. Reports show that about 10.5% of Americans are diabetic,[1] yet 15.7% of COVID-19 deaths are associated with diabetes.[2] This demonstrates a clear increased risk that should influence and inform public behavior especially for people who live with diabetes.

![diabetic-graph.jpg]()  

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention currently labels the following as comorbidities that increase a patient’s likelihood of contracting severe COVID-19 disease leading to hospitalization or death: 

*Chronic kidney disease, chronic lung disease, dementia or another neurological condition, diabetes, Down syndrome, heart conditions including hypertension, HIV, an immunocompromised state, liver disease, excess weight or obesity, pregnancy, sickle cell disease, organ or stem cell transplants, stroke or cerebrovascular disease, or substance use disorders including current and former cigarette smokers.[3] *

That list may seem overwhelming, but it’s reflective of the current state of research on the SARS-CoV-2 virus: there is still so much we do not know. Data on patient comorbidities are crucial to scientific research and development of new treatment options. The better we know how the virus works, the more likely we are to defeat it.

Due to the [absence of unified data management systems in the United States](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/pandemic-data-initiative/news/private-patient-data-best-practice-not-always-best-for-progress), much of what is known about COVID-19 comorbidities is not from active patient records, but death certificate data from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). There is also some comorbidity data in the CDC’s [Case Surveillance Data Set](https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/COVID-19-Case-Surveillance-Public-Use-Data-with-Ge/n8mc-b4w4), but this is a binary variable regarding whether the patient had any comorbidities, preventing analysis on the impact of any specific conditions. The other source of comorbidity information is individual researchers performing retrospective studies on patients who have already left the hospital. These studies involve isolated hospitals and medical systems complicated by the  disconnected nature of electronic medical records and the proprietary nature of patient data. Medical research has historically been performed in this manner, which is hyper-focused, repetitious, and limited in scope.

For example, cardiovascular comorbidities have been shown to correlate with increased risk of being put on a ventilator or dying from COVID-19 based on separate retrospective patient studies in Wuhan,[4] New York City,[5] and Los Angeles[6] among others. There are now even studies summarizing and aggregating the data from the separate cohort studies.[7] While these physicians and scientists are performing incredible work, this system for procuring comorbidity data from isolated health systems to make local conclusions that can then be compared to other studies is overly complex and time-consuming. The limiting step is data.

As of now, the only regularly updated, national source of COVID-19 comorbidity data is the CDC. They provide COVID-19 death data disaggregated by 22 comorbidity categories.[2] The CDC produces this dataset based on the release of official death records to the NCHS, which then processes, codes, and tabulates the data before releasing it to the public. This data offers the best comprehensive view of COVID-19 comorbidity data we have in the United States, but the CDC itself admits that this data has significant lag and is incomplete due to how different states process and report official death records.

When circumventing lag at CDC due to official recordkeeping, some states have done an incredible job throughout this pandemic providing real-time [data disaggregated by demographics](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/racial-data-transparency). Comorbidity data should be another prong of this data collection and reporting. In addition to being faster than the CDC, states can provide comorbidity data from COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations in addition to deaths. State dashboards have been rich data sources throughout this pandemic, and they would be well-suited to providing this data. States should also look at the capacity of comorbidity data to shape public health policy making in the most general of terms. 

![comorbidities-dashboard.jpg]()  

Utah’s dashboard is an excellent example of a state providing highly-detailed COVID-19 comorbidity data (A partial view is shown above).[8] Apart from comorbidity data for COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths, the state also provides the data disaggregated by race and ethnicity. The more data and cross-categorization that is accessible, the easier it becomes to analyze this disease. Utah is a great model, but unless other states also begin collecting and providing the same data, then the data can only be analyzed as an isolated study of COVID-19 in Utah.

That brings us to the constant issue with public health data in the United States – standardization. States have been unable to consistently define [demographic categories](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/pandemic-data-initiative/news/determining-discrete-data-points-from-the-sex-and-gender-spectra), [vaccine status](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/pandemic-data-initiative/news/complete-vaccination-data-a-moving-target), and [booster shot](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/pandemic-data-initiative/news/preparing-state-data-systems-for-booster-doses-and-breakthrough-cases) data, which are all data types with far fewer options and choices than comorbidities. A standard set of comorbidity options will need to be established and used by all states. The CDC and NCHS utilize the “ICD-10” codes, which are disease categorizations established by the World Health Organization and utilized throughout the medical field, making them excellent standards to employ nationwide. It is best to standardize prior to data collection and reporting as rebuilding the systems is much more difficult than building them correctly from the start, as we have seen with other COVID-19 data streams.

This data is important, but how it is collected and reported will determine how useful it truly is for defining a global understanding of COVID-19. A national unified data management system with clear and immediately useful definitions would remove the need to discuss standardization, as medical records would have the same options across the country. Analysis would also be simplified as much of the bureaucratic red tape preventing researchers from utilizing larger cohorts would be removed. This type of system exists outside of the United States, and it will be a major boon to combatting future public health crises if we begin working towards a unified medical record system now.

However, we currently have a disjointed, federated system whose confines we must work within. Therefore, the burden lies on the individual states once again to take the initiative to record this data and share it with the public. Decision-making is highly influenced by this data. Policy makers need to know if they represent populations that are at increased risk due to comorbidities to design more effective relief and mitigation strategies. There may also be conditions unlisted as risk factors due to the smaller sample sizes and incomplete data of studies already performed. Making this data easily available for researchers will also boost the speed and efficacy of COVID-19 research. While we do not have much data on COVID-19 and comorbidities right now, we have the capacity to collect, share, and analyze that data to hone in on the function and true danger of SARS-CoV-2.
